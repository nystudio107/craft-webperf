## Webperf Overview

Webperf uses [Real User Metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring) (RUM) captured from actual visitors to your website to profile its performance. In this way, Webperf passively gathers and monitors how your website performs on real-world devices used by real-world users.

Webperf uses the battle-tested [Boomerang](https://akamai.github.io/boomerang/) JavaScript from Akamai, loaded asynchronously in a non-blocking iframe. Boomerang uses performance information from the user's browser via the [Navigation Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API).
